# Regression Examples

This repository contains various regression examples implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of regression algorithms for practitioners and students to learn from and use as reference in their own projects.

Contents

The repository includes the following examples:

Simple linear regression
Multiple linear regression
Polynomial regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Neural Network Regression (using TensorFlow and PyTorch)
Each example is self-contained and includes a description of the problem, the implementation, and a brief analysis of the results.
